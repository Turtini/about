# About Turtini

Turtini LLC is a U.S.-based Red Hat reseller and open-source practitioner focused on public sector and regulated environments.

Turtini publishes public, versioned technical artifacts—including labs, governance frameworks, exam preparation materials, and reference implementations—primarily around Red Hat technologies such as OpenShift.

GitHub is used as Turtini’s primary public knowledge base. The organization emphasizes transparency, repeatable operational patterns, and practitioner-focused documentation rather than marketing content.

Turtini operates at the intersection of technical enablement and resale, helping customers and practitioners understand, evaluate, and operate enterprise open-source platforms in compliance-driven contexts.
